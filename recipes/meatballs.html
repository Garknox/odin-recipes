            <h2>Meatballs ingredients</h2>
            <p>
                Here's what you'll need to make the best meatballs of your life:
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Ground meat:</strong> This meatball recipe uses a blend of ground beef, ground veal, and ground pork. You can switch it up depending on what you have on hand.</li>
                <li><strong>Seasonings and herbs:</strong> These meatballs are flavored with fresh garlic, fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley, and ground black pepper.</li>
                <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs keep the meatballs from drying out and they act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the ingredients together.</li>
                <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> You'll need a cup of freshly grated Romano cheese. If you can, avoid the pre-grated stuff for this recipe.</li>
                <li><strong>Italian bread:</strong> Slightly stale Italian bread is preferable. If your bread feels soft, try letting it sit out overnight.</li>
                <li><strong>Water:</strong> Slowly add water to the mixture before you roll the meatballs. It'll keep the meatballs nice and moist. Some reviewers prefer to use milk.</li>
                <li><strong>Olive oil:</strong> Fry the meatballs in olive oil.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>How to make Meatballs step by step</h2>
            <p>
                Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make this top-rated meatball recipe:
                <ol>
                <li>Combine the first eight ingredients in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Add the bread crumbs and slowly add the water.</li>
                <li>Shape the mixture into meatballs.</li>
                <li>Fry the meatballs until they're all brown and crisp.</li>                
                </ol>
            </p>
            <h2>How long to cook Meatballs</h2>
            <p>
                Cook the meatballs in batches, making sure you don't crowd the pan. It should take about 20 minutes, 
                give or take, for the meatballs to be perfectly crisp and cooked through. Test their temperature first 
                to be sure they're done (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the middle of the meatball should read at least 165 degrees F).
