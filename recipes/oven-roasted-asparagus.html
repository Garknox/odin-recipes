            <h2>How to trim Asparagus</h2>
            <p>
                The quickest and easiest way to trim your asparagus is to line up all the (clean) stalks on a cutting board, then use a sharp chef’s 
                knife to cut off the thick ends. That’s all there is to it! If you’re worried about cutting at the wrong place, here’s a tip from recipe 
                creator swedishmilk: “To remove woody ends, grab a stalk of asparagus at either end and bend until it snaps. It will naturally snap where 
                it starts to get tough.”

            <h2>How to season Asparagus</h2>
            <p>
                This asparagus is simply seasoned with fresh garlic, sea salt, and black pepper. Parmesan cheese and fresh lemon juice also lend tons of 
                flavor. This is a versatile recipe, so feel free to add spices and customize the seasonings to suit your taste.

            <h2>How to cook Asparagus in the oven</h2>
            <p>
                Roasting asparagus couldn’t be easier: Toss the asparagus with olive oil and sprinkle it with cheese and seasonings. Arrange the stalks in 
                a single layer in a baking dish, then bake until tender. Sprinkle the roasted asparagus with lemon juice before serving, if you like.
